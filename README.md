# Celibrity Face Recognition (Sports Personalities Classification)

This project demonstrates a comprehensive step-by-step process for building a machine-learning model to classify images of sports personalities. The classification is restricted to five individuals: Maria Sharapova, Serena Williams, Virat Kohli, Roger Federer, and Lionel Messi.

### Project Overview:-
- Utilized Python, Numpy, and OpenCV for data loading and cleaning.<br>
- Employed Matplotlib and Seaborn for data visualization.<br>
- Used Haar Cascades for facial region detection and wavelet transformation for feature engineering.<br>
- Used Scikit-Learn for model building and training.<br>
- Applied various data science concepts such as data preprocessing, feature extraction, model evaluation, and hyperparameter tuning.

### Technology Stack:-
- Python: Programming language used for data analysis and model building.<br>
- Numpy and OpenCV: Libraries for data manipulation and image processing.<br>
- Matplotlib and Seaborn: Libraries for creating static, animated, and interactive visualizations.<br>
- Scikit-Learn (Sklearn): Library for machine learning, providing simple and efficient tools for data mining and data analysis.<br>
- Jupyter Notebook and Visual Studio Code: Environment for writing and running Python code.<be>
